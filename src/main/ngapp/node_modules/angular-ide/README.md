This module provides automatic ways of installing and interacting with the IDE.  For instance, if you want to get started:

> ngide install /path/to/ide

> ngide open src/app/main.ts

Would first install the IDE to your chosen path, and then you can open any file directly in the IDE to edit it.

Better yet, it can even integrate with ng serve so that as you are working with your command line tools, the Angular IDE stays up to date even reporting errors.
