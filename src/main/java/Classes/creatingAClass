to create a class in this project follow these steps:

1) create any corresponding tables in the db (save these alters to dataloader [this may change later])

2) follow the examples in this folder (such as medicalRecord.java) to create the base class

3) create the hibernate mapping file in src.main.resources (again follow the examples)

4) you should now be able to import and use your class (make sure to use a Service for any manipulation)
