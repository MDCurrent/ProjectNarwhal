The required software to run the db locally include:
	Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17
	Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Installation Center

Once you have the db setup create a hibernate.cfg.xml similar to hibernateSean.cfg.xml and add your local information so that hibernate 
can connect with the db

When you want to run the program locally go into hibernateUtil.java and change the configuration to load your config file

Download sqljdbc_6.0.8112.100_enu from microsoft and add sqljdbc_auth.dll to Java/'version'jdk/lib 
	(this will allow hibernate to login into the db using windows authentication)
	
run HibernateUtil.java as a java application and you should be able to add an entry into you db
